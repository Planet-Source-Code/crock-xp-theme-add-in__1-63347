### Description

This Add-In provides an easy way for your project to adopt the XP theme. Two components are added to your project (standard module and a resource file) and once compiled your project will adopt the XP theme (on XP OS only) without the external manifest file. Once this add-in is built it's a piece of cake for anyone, even a novice, to create a project displaying the XP theme.

Although there are many examples on this subject, this is a unique way to add the necessary components to a project.
